## Contributing

- Fork the repository, create a feature branch, and open a PR.
- Run `pre-commit run --all-files` before committing to keep diffs clean.
- If you add dependencies, update `requirements.txt` and consider adding a smoke check for new wiring.

See `docs/development.md` for the development workflow and test commands.
